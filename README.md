# Employee_Tracker

## Description
A command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. It's essentially a content management system (CMS) that allows non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. The CMS allows users to add and view company departments, roles, and employees. Below you will see an image of the application's database schema and a link to a video walk-through of how the application works.
